# Backend

This directory contains the backend code for the decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Solana blockchain. The backend is responsible for handling user authentication, project management, contributions, reviews, and interacting with the Solana blockchain for milestone verification and fund disbursement.

## Project Structure

The backend code is organized into the following directories and files:

- `src/controllers`: Contains the controllers for handling different functionalities of the platform.
  - `authController.js`: Handles user registration and authentication.
  - `projectController.js`: Handles project creation and listing.
  - `contributionController.js`: Handles contributions to projects.
  - `reviewController.js`: Handles feedback and reviews for completed projects.

- `src/models`: Contains the Sequelize models for the database entities.
  - `user.js`: Represents the user entity in the database.
  - `project.js`: Represents the project entity in the database.
  - `contribution.js`: Represents the contribution entity in the database.
  - `review.js`: Represents the review entity in the database.

- `src/routes`: Contains the routes for different functionalities of the platform.
  - `authRoutes.js`: Defines the routes for user authentication.
  - `projectRoutes.js`: Defines the routes for project management.
  - `contributionRoutes.js`: Defines the routes for handling contributions.
  - `reviewRoutes.js`: Defines the routes for submitting and retrieving reviews.

- `src/middlewares`: Contains the middleware functions used in the backend.
  - `authMiddleware.js`: Provides middleware functions for user authentication.
  - `validationMiddleware.js`: Provides middleware functions for input validation.

- `src/services`: Contains the services used in the backend.
  - `notificationService.js`: Handles sending notifications to users.
  - `solanaService.js`: Handles interactions with the Solana blockchain.

- `src/config`: Contains the configuration files for the backend.
  - `database.js`: Contains the configuration for the database connection.
  - `solanaConfig.js`: Contains the configuration for the Solana blockchain connection.

- `src/app.js`: Initializes the Express app and sets up middleware and routes.
- `src/server.js`: Starts the server.

- `package.json`: Lists the dependencies and scripts for the backend.
